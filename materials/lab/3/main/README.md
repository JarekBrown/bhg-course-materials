You'll have to specify if you want to use the port listing function I used, otherwise it will default to the previous search function.

Example: 
`SHODAN_API_KEY=your-key ./main ports`

As I commented in `main.go`, you will definitely want to pipe the output to some file. It is really long, since its all the ports Shodan crawls.
